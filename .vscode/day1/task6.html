        <h3>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language for creating web pages. It defines the structure and content of web documents using tags and attributes to format text, embed images, create links, and build interactive elements, facilitating communication between web browsers and servers.

            HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee who was founded in 1990, a physicist at the CERN research institute in Switzerland. When working with HTML, we just use a simple code structure that contains tags and attributes to build the structure of a webpage, and it is displayed as such by the browser
            The Cascade is an algorithm that defines combining the property values that originate from different sources. The significance of Cascade is to prioritize & resolve the conflict issues for determining the order of the final styling that will be applied to the HTML element if there exist multiple stylings(cascade layer) for the same element. This helps to set the value for a property on an element according to precedence when declared.

        <h3>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and plays an important role in providing the styles to the HTML elements, which helps to make web pages presentable. 

            CSS is essential for providing distinctive styles to elements and ensuring responsiveness across diverse screen sizes. Inline CSS commands the highest priority in styling. Web browsers implement the default styles to elements, which can be customized using CSS.
            n the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.</h3>
